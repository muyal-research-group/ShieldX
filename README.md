ShieldX is a secure management platform for microservices. It provides an integrated dashboard and toolset to manage, monitor, and secure your microservices environment. With robust encryption, secure communication channels, and scalable orchestration, ShieldX is designed to safeguard your infrastructure while ensuring efficient operations.
## ⚠️ Clone the repo and setup a remoto 🍴: 

1. You must clone the remote from the organization of Muyal: 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:muyal-research-group/ShieldX.git
```

2. You must create a fork (please check it up in the [Contribution](#contribution) section)

3. Add a new remote in your local git: 
   ```bash
   git remote add <remote_name> <ssh> 
   ```
You must select ```<remote_name>``` and you must copy the ```<ssh>``` uri in the github page of your

</div>

4. Remember to push all your commits to your ```<remote_name>``` to avoid github conflicts. 

Thats it!  let's get started 🚀

## Getting started

You must install the following software: 

- [Docker](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#linuxunix)
- Poetry
    ```bash
    pip3 install poetry
    ```
- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#linuxunix)
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://pyenv.run | bash
    ```


Once you get all the software, please execute the following command to install the dependencies of the project: 

```bash
poetry install
```

## 🐳 Deploy with Docker

This section explains how to build, run, and stop the **ShieldX** service using Docker and Docker Compose.

---

### 1️⃣ Running directly from Docker Hub

Since the image `edgar821/shieldx-api:latest` is already published on Docker Hub, you can start the full stack (API and MongoDB) **without building anything locally**.

Simply run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
````

Docker Compose will:

* Download `edgar821/shieldx-api:latest` from Docker Hub.
* Download `mongo:latest` if not already present.
* Start all containers with the configuration in `docker-compose.yml`.

---

### 2️⃣ Build the image locally (optional)

If you want to build the image from the `Dockerfile` instead of pulling from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker build -t edgar821/shieldx-api:latest .
```

**Explanation of parameters:**

* `-t edgar821/shieldx-api:latest` → Sets the name and tag for the image.
* `.` → The build context (current directory).

Or with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose build
```

To rebuild without using the cache:

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
```

---

### 3️⃣ Important Dockerfile parameters

* **Base Image:**
  `python:3.11-slim` → Lightweight Python image for faster builds and smaller final image size.

* **System Dependencies:**
  Installs packages needed for compiling Python libraries (e.g., `build-essential`, `libpq-dev`).

* **Poetry Setup:**
  Configures Poetry to install dependencies inside the project (`virtualenvs.in-project true`) and installs all dependencies from `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`.

* **Application Code:**
  Copies the source code into the container and sets the working directory to `/app`.

* **Entry Command:**
  Starts the FastAPI server with Uvicorn.

---

### 4️⃣ Important docker-compose parameters

* **`image`**:
  Uses `edgar821/shieldx-api:latest` from Docker Hub (no local build required).

* **`ports`**:
  Maps container ports to the host. Example: `"20000:20000"` makes the API available at `http://localhost:20000`.

* **`depends_on`**:
  Ensures `shieldx-db` (MongoDB) start before `shieldx-api`.

* **`volumes`**:
  Mounts persistent storage for MongoDB data.

---

### 5️⃣ Start the services

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

`-d` runs containers in detached mode.

---

### 6️⃣ Stop and clean up

To stop:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

⚠️ **Warning:** The `-v` option deletes volumes, which means all MongoDB data will be lost.

---

### 7️⃣ Environment variables

`docker-compose.yml` can load variables from a `.env` file (not committed to the repository) for settings like:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://shieldx-db:27017
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

You can document them here or in a `.env.example` without sensitive data.

---

### 8️⃣ Accessing and Running the Service

* **API endpoint:** [http://localhost:20000](http://localhost:20000)
* **API Docs (Swagger UI):** [http://localhost:20000/docs](http://localhost:20000/docs)

#### Running the FastAPI Server locally (development mode)



```bash
poetry run python3 ./shieldx/server.py
```

---
