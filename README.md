ShieldX is a secure management platform for microservices. It provides an integrated dashboard and toolset to manage, monitor, and secure your microservices environment. With robust encryption, secure communication channels, and scalable orchestration, ShieldX is designed to safeguard your infrastructure while ensuring efficient operations.

## Getting started

You must install the following software: 

- [Docker](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#linuxunix)
- Poetry
    ```bash
    pip3 install poetry
    ```
- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#linuxunix)
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://pyenv.run | bash
    ```


Once you get all the software, please execute the following command to install the dependencies of the project: 

```bash
poetry install
```

## üê≥ Deploy with Docker

This section explains how to build, run, and stop the **ShieldX** service using Docker and Docker Compose.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Running directly from Docker Hub

Since the image `edgar821/shieldx-api:latest` is already published on Docker Hub, you can start the full stack (API and MongoDB) **without building anything locally**.

Simply run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
````

Docker Compose will:

* Download `edgar821/shieldx-api:latest` from Docker Hub.
* Download `mongo:latest` if not already present.
* Start all containers with the configuration in `docker-compose.yml`.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Build the image locally (optional)

If you want to build the image from the `Dockerfile` instead of pulling from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker build -t edgar821/shieldx-api:latest .
```

**Explanation of parameters:**

* `-t edgar821/shieldx-api:latest` ‚Üí Sets the name and tag for the image.
* `.` ‚Üí The build context (current directory).

Or with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose build
```

To rebuild without using the cache:

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Important Dockerfile parameters

* **Base Image:**
  `python:3.11-slim` ‚Üí Lightweight Python image for faster builds and smaller final image size.

* **System Dependencies:**
  Installs packages needed for compiling Python libraries (e.g., `build-essential`, `libpq-dev`).

* **Poetry Setup:**
  Configures Poetry to install dependencies inside the project (`virtualenvs.in-project true`) and installs all dependencies from `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`.

* **Application Code:**
  Copies the source code into the container and sets the working directory to `/app`.

* **Entry Command:**
  Starts the FastAPI server with Uvicorn.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Important docker-compose parameters

* **`image`**:
  Uses `edgar821/shieldx-api:latest` from Docker Hub (no local build required).

* **`ports`**:
  Maps container ports to the host. Example: `"20000:20000"` makes the API available at `http://localhost:20000`.

* **`depends_on`**:
  Ensures `shieldx-db` (MongoDB) start before `shieldx-api`.

* **`volumes`**:
  Mounts persistent storage for MongoDB data.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Start the services

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

`-d` runs containers in detached mode.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Stop and clean up

To stop:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** The `-v` option deletes volumes, which means all MongoDB data will be lost.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Environment variables

`docker-compose.yml` can load variables from a `.env` file not committed to the repository for security reason, but an example is shown here:

```env
API_PORT=20000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://shieldx-db:27017
RABBITMQ_PORT=5672
RABBIT_MAQ_MANAGEMENT_PORT=15672
LOG_LEVEL=info
API_IMAGE=edgar821/shieldx-api:latest
```

You can document them here or in a `.env.example` without sensitive data.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Accessing and Running the Service

* **API endpoint:** [http://localhost:20000](http://localhost:20000)
* **API Docs (Swagger UI):** [http://localhost:20000/docs](http://localhost:20000/docs)

#### Running the FastAPI Server locally (development mode)



```bash
poetry run python3 ./shieldx/server.py
```

---
